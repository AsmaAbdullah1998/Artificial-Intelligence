   will be erased, so back up any important files first plz!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINALLY, THESE ARE DIFFTRENT WAYS TO REACH THE SAME GOAL WHICH IS WORKING ON UBUNTU. FROM MY PRESPECTIVE,THE SECOND METHOD IS THE 
MOST DIFFICULT PART AND IT HAS AN EFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR PC. HOWEVER, I PREFER IT AS I CAN USE UBUNTU EASILY WITHOUT
THE NEED TO EXTERNAL USB OR USING THE VM BOX WHICH IS SLOW AND MAKES ME NERVOUS!! BUT I CAN SAY THE THE VM BOX IS VERY SIMPLE AND 
EASY TO FOLLOW THEN THE BOOTABLE USB. IT'S ALSO INTERSITING TO NOTE THAT, MAYBE THE BOOTABLE USB IS MORE SAFE FOR YOUR DEVICE
AT THE END YOU ARE FREE TO CHOOSE.....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOOD WORK....! 
After we finished Ubuntu instaltion part NOW let's download ROS and this step is working for all previous methods!
Because we will install ROS on Ubuntu
First:
It is important to note that the disribution of ROS is depending on the version of the Ubuntu in my case my Ubuntu was 18.04 
but I followed this link to upgrade my ubuntu 18.04 to 20 >>https://ubuntu.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-from-ubuntu-18-04-lts-to-20-04-lts-today
 Now lets install ROS Noetic://this is just for ubuntu 20.04 version
 1-Opent the terminal command
 2-copy and paste: wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qboticslabs/ros_install_noetic/master/ros_install_noetic.sh && chmod +x ./ros_install_noetic.sh && ./ros_install_noetic.sh
 3-type 1 for installing the full Desktop
 4-type rosversion -d //output should be: neotic
 5-type: roscore
 6-rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker
 7-rosrun roscpp_tutorials listener
